## Background to Story

A Pier to the Past is an exploration game about Brighton, written in Python and designed to run on a small kiosk cabinet with simple controls. It features bitesize chunks of Brighton history, presented as three stories with each story lasting only five minutes or so. The player will learn lesser-known  historic facts that even long-term residents have little knowledge of.
