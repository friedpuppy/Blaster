# A Pier to the Past

A Pier to the Past is a final-year student project for the BSc Computer Games Design course at the University of Brighton. It is written by Callum Donnelly, as submission of final thesis. The project has been developed in Pygame-ce, a community lead development of the Pygame library. Additional tools used have included Gemini Code Assist & PyTMX.

## Background to Story

A Pier to the Past is an exploration game about Brighton, written in Python and designed to run on a small kiosk cabinet with simple controls. It features bitesize chunks of Brighton history, presented as three stories with each story lasting only five minutes or so. The player will learn lesser-known  historic facts that even long-term residents have little knowledge of.
